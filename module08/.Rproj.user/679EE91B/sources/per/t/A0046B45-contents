This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

##Question 2

```{r}
cars <- c("Truck", "Car", "SUV")
mpg_ <- c(11,30,24)
cost <- c(45000,25000,35000)

df <- data.frame(cars,mpg_,cost)
df
```

##Question 2a

The first command is df[1,3] which selects the cost of the truck.
The next command is df[1:3] which returns the first 3 rows from the dataframe. This means the entire dataframe was selected.
Finally we have df[3] which returns the last column. This selects every value in the cost column.
```{r}
df[1,3]
df[1:3]
df[3]
```

##Question 3

```{r}
head(mtcars,3)
tail(mtcars,5)
```

##Question 4

```{r}
# Categorical values
colnames(mtcars)[2]
colnames(mtcars)[10]
# Continous values
colnames(mtcars)[1]
colnames(mtcars)[3]
```

##Question 5

Running the command doesn't work at first because I didn't have ggplot2 installed. After running the installation you must import the library using library("ggplot2").
The plot displays now but it doesn't have any points so we have to add them with geom_point().
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
```

##Question 6

This scatterplot shows the engine displacement in liters versus the highway fuel economy. The plot shows that there is a negative correlation between the two values and that the number of cylinders increases as the volume displaced increases.
```{r}
mpg
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color=factor(cyl)))
```

##Question 7

The drv column is a categorical value that tells us if the car is front wheel, rear wheel, or 4 wheel drive.
The command facet_wrap(~ drv) seperates the plot into 3 different plots based on the drive of the car.
This allows us to see that most cars with 4 cylinders tend to be front wheel drive and if cars are rear wheel then they're almost alwyas 8 cylinders. We can also see that front wheel drive tends to get better fuel efficeincy than 4 wheel drive.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color=factor(cyl))) + facet_wrap(~ drv)
```
